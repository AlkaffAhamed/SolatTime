Muslims are obliged to follow the 5 pillars and one of them is Solat (the diagram spelt it as "Salat"). Solat is an Arabic word which means "Prayer". 

### Solat (Obligatory Prayer)

All muslims are obliged to pray 5 times a day and there are specific timings for each of the 5 prayers based on the position of the sun during the day. These are the 5 prayers. 

1. Subuh (or Fajr) 
2. Zohr 
3. Asar 
4. Maghrib 
5. Isha 

#### Determining the Prayer Time 

Earlier, the position of the sun and the length of the shadow were used to determine the prayer. After the invention of clocks and advancement in mathematics, the timings were
calculated and usually made into a table these days. 

Since most people these days carry a smartphone with them, it would be even more convenient to design an application that displays the timings for each prayers right from the phone. 



## Islamic Calendar 

All Islamic events are based on the Islamic Calendar (or also known as Hijri Calendar) dates. Islamic Calendar is a separate system which follows the lunar calendar, unlike the Gregorian Calendar that follows the solar calendar. Both have 12 months but the number of days in each month and the total number of days in Gregorian Calendar year and Islamic Calendar year are different. 

Since most of the world is functioning based on the Gregorian Calendar, a need to convert the dates between Gregorian and Islamic Calendar arises. By converting the dates, it will be possible to point out when the Islamic events are in the Gregorian Calendar, thus allowing muslims to prepare for any prayers for any of the Islamic events.
